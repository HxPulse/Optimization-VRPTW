Plnety of method examples can be computed in the Main.java file.

Each code part is commented and is explained by it's title also acting as the boundary to uncomment it for testing purposes.
To uncomment, remove the "/*" and "*/" elements respectively at the beginning and the end of a section.
When a section has been tested, it must be recommented before trying another one.


The function getFile("dataXXX") recovers the data from a precise data set. 
All data sets can be used properly on all code sections.
To change data set, change the id in the function parameter (ex getFile("data1202");).


The output() function precedeed by a solution (ex sol.output()) recovers all routes and the fitness of the said solution and writes them in the file Data/output.txt.
Watch out as this function doesn't overwrite the text file. You might need to empty it before running a test to make sure you'll gather the correct results.
